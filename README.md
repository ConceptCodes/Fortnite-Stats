# Fortnite-Stats
This is apart of a challenge I've called upon myself to post a repo a day. Its currently 11:28 pm so i think i made the deadline. This is a jupyter notebook with some data science Ive been doing with fortnite data. After a couple more repos i will update the readme with a full analysis.
